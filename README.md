# 👋 Hello there, welcome to my Github profile!
## 🤔 I'm not sure how you stumbled upon my little corner of the internet, but I'm glad you're here!

#### 👨‍💻 I'm a self-taught developer who loves to explore new technologies and learn new things. I'm not limited to just one technology and enjoy working on a variety of projects.
#### 💻 Some of my recent projects include building a web app using React, creating a RESTful API, or making my life easier with C#, and also experimenting with different technologies.
#### 🌟 When I'm not coding, you can find me watching a movie, reading, or playing a newly released game.
#### 📫 Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or just want to say hi! Thanks for stopping by.
